👋 Hi, I am Humphrey and welcome to my site

I use 🐍 python and 🦄 django to build the 🕸web.

I am a `Python Software Foundation(PSF) Fellow <https://www.python.org/psf/fellows-roster>`_ and a member of the  `Django Software Foundation(DSF) <https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members>`_.

I am a believer in and contributor to open source.My contributions are not  only code related. I also volunteer to organize local meetups and international conferences such as `DjangoCon Africa <https://2023.djangoconafrica.com>`_ and `PyCon Zimbabwe <https://zim.pycon.org>`_. As recognition for my service to the Python community I was awarded the `Python Software Foundation Q4 2020 Community Service Award <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/11/humphrey-butau-awarded-psf-community.html>`_.

I also enjoy trail running and tinkering with electronics especially switch mode power supply systems.
