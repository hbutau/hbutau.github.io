If you are reading this, thank you for visiting my blog. I can't wait to share with you my thoughts, aspirations and work. If you love Python and running you will not be disappointed. In the immediate future, I will be writing about the upcoming `DjangoCon Africa <https://2023.djangocon.africa>`_ Conference to be held in Zanzibar Tanzania. 

So stay tuned. Meanwhile, we can network on the fediverse `here <https://fosstodon.org/@hamub>`_
