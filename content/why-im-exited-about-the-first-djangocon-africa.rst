The first ever DjangoCon Africa conference will be held in Zanzibar, Tanzania starting from November 6th to the 7th. 
I cannot hide how excited I am about this, even though I do not know whether I will be in attendance or not.

It is about open source

Its is a community event. I missed Pycon Africa and havent been attending any conferences
since 2018

Its in Zanzibar and I love the beach
